# Etch-A-Sketch Web App ðŸŽ¨

## Project Overview

Welcome to my **Etch-A-Sketch web app**! This project is a **fun recreation** based on the classic **Etch-A-Sketch** toy, which I developed as part of **The Odin Project** to hone my **web development skills**. This app is purely for educational purposes, and it is **not affiliated with any brand** like Crayola or Micrografx. Itâ€™s a **non-commercial, personal project** that allows users to draw simple designs using a classic **Etch-A-Sketch-style interface**.

## Features

- **Responsive Canvas:** Draw freely on a grid using up, down, left, and right buttons, just like the real Etch-A-Sketch!
- **Reset Functionality:** Clear the drawing to start over.
- **Stylized UI:** Retro design inspired by 90s-era creative tools.

## Purpose

This project is part of my journey through **The Odin Project**, a free curriculum that teaches web development. My goal was to create an interactive, nostalgic drawing experience that replicates the simplicity of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Disclaimer

This is a **personal project** aimed at improving my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the app, including retro-themed elements.
- **JavaScript**: Creating the drawing functionality and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Use the arrow buttons to move the cursor and draw on the canvas.
3. Press **Reset** to clear the screen and start over.
